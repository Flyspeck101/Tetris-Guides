Being able to do T-Spin Doubles (TSDs) midgame is a very important skill. Newer players might watch higher skill players seemingly counjure T-spins out of thin air, but they have no idea how to do it themselves. So we have the idea of height differences. 

When we have a centre stack (5-4, 6-3, 7-2), the 1-block gap in the middle is known as the well. To be able to make a T-Spin, the the column directly to to left and directly to the right must be the same height, which we say has height difference of 0. If the height difference isn't 0, then a T-Spin isn't possible. So, to make a T-spin you must place some pieces to bring the height difference to 0. 

There are three main height differences: 1, 2 and 3. If the height difference is greater than 3, you can use an I piece to bring up one side.
